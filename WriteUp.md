#### GENERATING THE PATHS ####

First the coordinates of the car are taken and if we have just started and there is not enough points yet, we generate two extra points for the trajectory by reflecting backwards from the current location. If there are already previous points, we take 2 of those previous points instead of making them and then we generate 3 extra points each within 30m from the the other. The new points are generated for the lane which is selceted. After this Transfer all these points to the coordinate system of the car and then fit a polynomial to these points by using the spline library (spline just guarantees that the fitted line goes through all the points). After this the coordinates are transformed back to the global coordinate system and published for the simulator.
